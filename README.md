# Rationale #

* This document describes the software that brings a _custom_ solution: a visual database of all hardware assets that belongs to the institution
* It comes with an inner searcher that shows a visual representation of the object searched with all the linked metadata already gathered
* There are both tutorials for this solution-driven application: [espa√±ol](tutorial_esp.md) and [english](tutorial.md)
