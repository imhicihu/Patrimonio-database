* Configuration
     - Download our database from the `Downloads` section
* Dependencies
     - No dependencies
* Database configuration
     - Since it is custom programmed, this _visual_ database fills our needs.
* Deployment instructions

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Code review
     - This software is shared and can be _hacked_ with your custom needs. You can modify the order, the placement of graphics, the [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), _et alia_.
     - You need some knowledge of [ScriptMaker](https://community.filemaker.com/thread/164531#) to append or obliterate functions from this database.
